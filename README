PinnacleDice.pl
---------------
Script to roll dice, using the Pinnacle Deadlands rolling convention.

CardDraw.pl
-----------
Using the DL_Deck.pm perl module from thebrogue.com, a program to randomly generate a card from
a deck.  The code shuffles the pack each time, which may not be waht you want for Deadlands
or Savage Worlds, but feel free to submit patches!
TODO: add command line switch to prevent deck shuffling, as above.
TODO: replace the boilerplate documentation with something usefull

Chip Tracker
------------

A series of scripts that manage the chips used in Deadlands/Savage Worlds. 
Since our group was often forgetting how many chip were in the pot, I put this together. 
When I started to use my laptop more for the game, I found the generation of random draws usefull. 
You can still give the players the chips, but now they're easier to manage (the chips, not the players. Theres only so much I can do with a program you know...:-)

Contains the following programs:

Initialise.pl Create a database with the default number of starting chips
Show.pl list all the chips in the specified database.
Modify.pl Allows additions and deletions to the specified database.
Pick.pl Generates a specified number of chips randomly.

Since you can specify the database to use, you can have one generic "pot" for people to draw from, and one pot for the chips available to the Marshal.  

This is old code, and I want to implement the following;
TODO: rewrite the command line to use Gepot::Euclid
TODO: Add inline POD 
TODO: work out a way of recordsing all the players chip totals, and easily updating them at end of a session.
